## About Me

I am a researcher and developer specializing in **Deep Learning**, with a deep focus on **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. I am currently pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science and an M.S. by Research in Computational Linguistics at the **International Institute of Information Technology (IIIT), Hyderabad**.

My M.S. thesis research centers on advancing **Machine Translation** for low-resource Indian languages and exploring advanced alignment techniques like **RLHF**, including methods such as **DPO** and **KTO**. I am a **Kaggle Grandmaster** and an active **NLP Blogger on Medium**, where my articles have amassed over **300,000+ views**.

- üî¨ Publishing research in top-tier NLP conferences like **NAACL, WMT, EAMT, and MT Summit**.
- üë®‚Äçüíª Building practical, open-source AI/ML tools. Check out my `codetoprompt` library on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/codetoprompt/)!
- ‚úçÔ∏è Sharing my knowledge on advanced NLP topics on my [Medium blog](https://medium.com/@yash9439).
- üèÜ Passionate about competitive machine learning and problem-solving.

## Featured Research & Engineering Projects

Here are some of my latest projects that highlight my work in Deep Learning and NLP.

- **[codetoprompt](https://github.com/yash9439/codetoprompt)**  
  A powerful CLI tool that transforms local codebases, GitHub repositories, and web content into a single, optimized prompt for LLMs. Features an interactive file selector, smart code compression, and multiple output formats.  
  [Check it out on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/codetoprompt/).

- **[Test-Time Compute for SLMs](https://github.com/yash9439/Test-time-compute-SLMs)**  
  An in-depth research project exploring test-time compute allocation (like budget forcing) to enhance reasoning in Small Language Models (SLMs). We benchmarked models like Phi-3 and Qwen-1.5B on advanced reasoning tasks (MATH, GPQA) using techniques like CoT/CoD prompting and GRPO fine-tuning.

- **[Multi-Agent Open-Domain Q&A System](https://github.com/yash9439/MultiAgent-OpenDomain-QnA-System)**  
  A sophisticated Q&A system built with specialized agents for query modification, document retrieval (sparse and dense), ranking, and answer generation to tackle complex, open-domain questions.

- **[RAG with Llama3 Agents](https://github.com/yash9439/RAG-with-Agents-llama3)**  
  An implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline leveraging Llama-3 and the ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) agent framework to provide accurate, context-aware responses from a knowledge base.
